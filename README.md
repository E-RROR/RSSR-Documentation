- `npm run start-pm2-low` for start project with [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) tools and run production server over one core of CPU.
- `npm run start-pm2` is like `npm run start-pm2-low` but run over all CPU core. (learn more about it in [PM2 cluster](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/)) (Recommend for Main production)
