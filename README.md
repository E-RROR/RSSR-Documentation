2. Run `npm i` (install npm packages)
3. Run `npm run build` (building the project and inject it in to `/dist` directory at root of project)
4. Run one of below commands
#### initial start: 
- `npm run start` for start project with `node` runner (recommends for testing production).
- `npm run start-pm2-low` for start project with [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) tools and run production server over one core of CPU.
- `npm run start-pm2` is like `npm run start-pm2-low` but run over all CPU core. (learn more about it in [PM2 cluster](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/)) (Recommend for Main production)

#### Updating: 
- `npm run up-low`, mix of delete available process and `npm run start-pm2-low` (once CPU core)
- `npm run up`,like `npm run up-low` but over all CPU core (Recommend for Main production)

### SEO
We use [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for managing document head tags. Examples on how to
write head tags can be found [here](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet#examples).
Also we use [rssr-seo-optimization](https://github.com/rssr-org/rssr-seo-optimization) that redirect domains starting with www to non-www and remove slash at the end of URL for improve SEO
