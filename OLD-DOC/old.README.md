## Overview

## Usage Tips
- Run commands at root of project.

## Quick start

- Make sure that you have Node.js v10.13.0 and npm v6 or above installed.
- Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/rssr-org/RSSR.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
- Move to your local directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
- Select one of the following instructions based on your environment

### Run in Development mode
1. Run `npm i` (install npm packages).
2. Run `npm run dev` in other next terminal (start running project in development mode).
3. Stay for initial build to be able to see App over`localhost:8000` (App will be opened in browser automatically).

#### remove fake API
In the real project you must remove fakeApi. 
1. Go to `~/provider/server/development.js`, find `require('../setup/fakeApi')(app)` and remove it.
3. Go to `~/provider/setup` and remove `fakeApi.js` file.
4. Change `API_HOST_IN_CLIENT` and `API_HOST_IN_SERVER` in `.env` file. 

### Run in Production mode
1. Pull changes from Git.
2. Run `npm i` (install npm packages).
3. Run `npm run build` (building the project and inject it in to `/dist` directory at root of project).
4. Run one of the following commands.
#### initial start: 
- `npm run start` for starting the project by `nodejs` runner (recommended for testing production).
- `npm run start-pm2-low` for starting the project by [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) tools and run production server over one core of CPU.
- `npm run start-pm2` is like `npm run start-pm2-low` but it runs over all CPU core. (learn more about it in [PM2 cluster](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/)) (recommended for main production)


#### Updating

- `npm run up-low`, mix of delete available process and `npm run start-pm2-low` (once CPU core)
- `npm run up`,like `npm run up-low` but over all CPU core (recommended for main production)
